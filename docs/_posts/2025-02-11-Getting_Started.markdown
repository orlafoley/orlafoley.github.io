## Getting Started
This is an attempt at a blog post. Allegedly. 

It's been a hot minute since I've used markdown. I can't wait to see how this renders. Or maybe doesn't render which would be even funnier. I used it in first year of college which feels like a lifetime ago, was that really before covid happened?

So far I have a large collection of items from work; two of lots of things. Two laptops, two operating systems, two email addresses, two calendars, two messaging apps, and two sets of people from two companies to talk to. It feels like a strange remix of that [Breakfast Roll song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo99q4S3Xo) or a modern retelling of the tale of Noah's ark. Two of everything.

I've had a few technical issues so it'll take a bit longer to hit my stride. That's fine, I'll figure it out... eventually. 

So far I've spent a lot of time watching videos and clicking through quizzes. I'm getting up to speed slowly but surely. New jobs are like new shoes; there's a certain amount of time you need to break them in. Almost every job I've had throughout my life has had a training period at the start. I usually prefer being as hands on as possible at this point. It's easier to do a little bit of training and put it into practice so you really understand what's happening. I did that in my last job. I built a small LAMP stack project rather than just blindly watching videos which really helped.

I'll leave it here for the time being. I'll make another one of these at another point so I'll probably have more to write at that point.
